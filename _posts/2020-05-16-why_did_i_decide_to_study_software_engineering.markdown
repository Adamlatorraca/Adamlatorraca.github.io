#### Well, it's pretty cool right?
​
That's half the story for me. I've always had an interest in poking and prodding at the latest technology, but my interest in competitive gaming propelled me from someone who liked new technology to someone who needed new technology. This new monitor from Company A has a higher refresh rate, this new mouse from Company B has a more accurate sensor, this keyboard by Company C responds to key presses 2 milliseconds faster. It's easy to get wrapped up in the world of hardware when they're your favorite tools you use every day. But what happens when you're older, physically and mentally slower, and have less time to play and practice your esport of choice? You take a step back and it's clear to see how much more important the software was than the hardware I was using to operate it. I don't love my keyboard or my mouse or my monitor but I do love my favorite games. So what should I do?
​
#### I should study Software Engineering
​
It wasn't that logical of a leap as I may have just made it seem. It turns out I find playing video games infinitely more enjoyable than I find attempting to make my own. So while that's out of the question, the fact of the matter is that I've never been more interested in what makes the software I use every day tick.  Hardware companies are constantly creating new ways to interact with software, but the software is what congregates people. Whether they congregate around a game or the sharing of ideas, or posting pictures of their pets, they are all congregating on the platforms that they love (or love to hate) regardless of what phone or laptop or tablet or desktop or smart watch they choose to use. Software is uniting while hardware is dividing. Where does that leave me?

#### Flatiron School

It leaves me at the end of the first mile and what a first mile it has been. I have new coworkers who rely on each other every day. I have the responsibility of staying on pace with my lessons. I have to try and balance cementing what I've learned and still looking forward to my next challenge. It hasn't been easy and won't be easy, but I intend on following through with my core belief. I will learn what makes the software I use every day tick. From there, who knows? Maybe work for a major tech company working on their software. Maybe a coworker will turn cofounder as we develop our own ideas and portfolio. No matter what, though, I'm sure it'll be difficult and rewarding.
